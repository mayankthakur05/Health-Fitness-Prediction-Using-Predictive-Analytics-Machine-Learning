🏋️‍♂️ Health & Fitness Prediction Using Predictive Analytics & Machine Learning






🌟 Project Overview

This project predicts an individual's overall health and fitness status using machine learning and predictive analytics. It leverages health and lifestyle data to:

Analyze health patterns with EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Train multiple machine learning models

Determine the best-performing model

Enable users to predict personal health & fitness through an interactive menu

The goal is to provide a data-driven tool to monitor health and help make informed lifestyle decisions.

📊 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize overall health condition distribution

Analyze stress levels vs. health condition

Correlation heatmap of numeric variables
Machine Learning Models

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree (with pruned tree visualization)

Random Forest (primary model for prediction)

Predictive Analytics

Predict Healthy / Not Healthy based on user inputs

Calculates BMI automatically

Provides probability-based predictions

Model Evaluation

Accuracy score and confusion matrix for each model

Bar chart comparison to determine the best-performing model
